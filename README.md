# Functional Pearl: Inside the Convex Hull
This is an implementation of Richard Bird's functional pearl "Inside the Convex Hull". 
The goal is to determine whether a point lies inside a convex hull in any rational Euclidian space. 
The tests are written using the [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) library. 
This project is implemented using the [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) extension for Jupyter. 

After installing the IHaskell extension, you can run jupyter from the IHaskell directory using:
```
stack exec jupyter -- notebook
```
